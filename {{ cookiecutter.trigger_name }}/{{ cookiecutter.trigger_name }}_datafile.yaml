#* Trigger Datafile schema
#* -----------------------
#*
#* Production schema with commentary from the devs

extends: # Use this field to extend an existing yaml Trigger file,
         # allowing you to create an inheritance hierarchy.
         # Supports full path/names or names of file in the the same dir.
         # ``Genie`` provides a master set of triggers for you to extend
         # from as a start. It is found at:
         # <$virtual_env>/lib/python3.4/site-packages/genie/infra/triggers.yaml

{{ cookiecutter.trigger_name }}: # Trigger name goes here

    source: # This section is used to let
            # Genie know where the trigger class
            # is located.

        class: # Location of the class that contains the trigger.
               # (Example: sdk.triggers.shutnoshut.shutnoshut.TriggerShutNoShutOspf)

    devices: # Devices lists to execute the verification.
             # Can either be an alias or device hostname
             # as defined in the pyats testbed file.
             # If there is no device, the verification will not execute.
